Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP) for the instrument [Liger (InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer)](https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/liger.html), Liger is a second generation instrument for the W.M. Keck Observatory.

The DRP is based on [JWST' pipeline tool `stpipe`](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst).

The design of Liger and the existing DRP code is copied from the IRIS instrument for TMT, for which the existing documentation refers and applies to.
